Hello there, and welcome to the official Vanilla Extract website repository!
### What is Vanilla Extract?
Created very recently in 2020, Vanilla Extract (or just VE) is a new Minecraft resource/data pack picker, similar to [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net). Being under construction right now, our website is not quite at the finish line yet. For now, you can visit our [temporary site](https://sites.google.com/view/vanillaextract), or our [Github links page](https://github.com/Vanilla-Extract/TempDownloadLinks/tree/main/Packs) to get our same quality packs!

## I'm interested, how can I join?
Thanks for checking us out! Whether you qustions, make packs, mods, or just want to stay on the side and everything in between, you can join us via [this link](https://discord.io/vanillaextract).

# A ~~brief~~ long history of Vanilla Extract
   The Discord server (the start of this entire project) was created, and is still maintained by **DTRW191**. The Discord enthusiast who had recently just started the journey through the young platform originally called the Discord server the "*Melon Society*." But was joined in by [**Chromus**](https://chromus.tk), who was the next person to change the for the better, quite a bit! After gaining the trust from DTRW191, Chromus became the server co-owner, and technically the co-founder as well. Changing the name to "*Vanilla Extract*" by a personal request, he continued the lost purpose of the server by inviting several people who've had experience in creating packs, Mainly [**Beatso**](https://www.beatso.tk/), who will later play a large part up to now on the project. Anyhow, as DTRW191 put it up on [*Disboard*](https://disboard.org/server/728777189914312715), the server started to gain more traction, eventually leading the two owners to ask Beatso of a special request. To make [**Extractor**](https://github.com/Vanilla-Extract/Extractor), a custom Discord bot to help around with tasks similar to Beatso's own bot [**Bj√∂rn**](https://github.com/Beatso/Bjorn), and Vanilla Tweaks bot. Things such as its faq feature sped of explanations tenfold, and continued evolving, as more and more features came into mind (Beatso is fine right now, he ain't our personal assistant and has his own schedule, helping others out too). Having a mix of not only resource pack creators but consumers as well, the already made *texture artist* was put into play, creating a simple google form, DTRW191 made a simple way to sign up for this role, to recieve confirmation that you are legit and can help out when needed. As more people came in and more people became texture artists, the role became too common (at the time) and applications were officially closed for the time being. thinking, DTRW191 and Chromus needed a more complex thing as another system came into play. Another pack selector, [*Faithful Tweaks*](https://faithfultweaks.com/) (now Compliance Tweaks) who had a similar goal, but to create Vanilla Tweaks same packs in 32x, had created a website via [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Now, Chromus became very interested in this, and announced to DTRW191 that he was going to attempt to create a website based off of Faithful Tweaks, and got the help from [**Banakin**](https://github.com/banakin), the main Faithful Tweaks web developers to kickstart his journey. And then even after that, Beatso happened to use the same channel Chromus and Banakin used! This ultimatly lead to Beatso sharing his unknown knowledge of Hugo and web development, having become the web developer for [*FingerMaps*](https://fingermaps.net). And soon afterward, the first Datapack maker came into play, [**SoulSpark**](https://github.com/a-soulspark). The introduction of SoulSpark wasn't much, as he was a bystander for a long time, then told DTRW191 and Chromus about his skill in the making of such packs. Then, as he got the new role, more people came in and were given the role as well. Basically leading up to the present. I'd like to thank everyone who's ever done anything for the project. You've helped shape VE into what it is today! **- Last Updated: 20-12-2020**
